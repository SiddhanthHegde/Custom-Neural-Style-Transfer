# Custom-Neural-Style-Transfer

Customized way of transferring style from a style image using mobilenet v2 rather than using vgg19 (as used in the original paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576.pdf). Conventional optimizer Adam was used instead of L-BFGS and other small changes were made. Implementation in pytorch.
